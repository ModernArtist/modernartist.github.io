# Impostor - game aid

This is the first version of the Impostor game aid I wrote.

It uses jquery and foundation 6.

This version still has more features than my Angular 2 rewrite:

* Player names are stored to local storeage to avoid losing names if someone reloads the page or closes their browser accidentally.
* Names are validated.
